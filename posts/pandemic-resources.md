While we are all working from home, self-isolating, and practicing social distancing- we probably all have some extra time on our hands. And there's only so many Netflix shows to watch right? So, if you have ever wanted to learn anything new here but weren't sure where to start, here is a list of resources that I have personally used and some that I have come across but have not yet used myself. (disclaimer: most of these things are geared towards developers but there are plenty of things for design, UX, problem solving, and much more here too)

## Things I have signed up for/purchased that I believe are worth a look at:

You can get [Codecademy Pro for free](https://bit.ly/2wyiuSN). This gives you access to Projects, Road Maps, Courses and tons of other fun goodies.(This is limited to students who have a email address ending in .edu.)

[LevelUpTutorials](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/) (@ScottTolinski) is also running a 50% off sale for professional memberships right now, which is still not cheap by any means, but I do believe they are quality resources.

## Other paid Resources:

I have not personally purchased any of [Wes Bos' courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) before, however, I have followed him on other platforms and used him as a learning resource. But he is also running 50% sales on his courses. (Although, if you want the React + GraphQL course I think he plans to re-release that one soon so I might hold of on buying the old one just yet)

I have taken a few different courses from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/development/web-development/), prices fluctuate so I recommend keeping an eye on a course you think you might want. It's kind of hit or miss, but they have a money back guarantee so you can always try a course and see if you think it is right for you.

Adam13531 has just launched his own webiste that will feature a variety of different courses, you can learn more about the awesome work Adam is doing on his [new site](https://adamlearns.live/).

I have never used [TeamTreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/), but it has a lot of great reviews and people recommend it a lot.

## Free Resources:

[Google's Digital Garage](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/courses) is a free resource packed with over 100 unique courses on everything from self care to starting your own online buisiness.They offer a handful of courses in development, ranging from introduction to programming, to basics of python, to computational problem solving. There are even a few courses on design.

[FullStackOpen](https://fullstackopen.com/en) is a free, online version of the Full Stack course taught at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki. This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
This site has a lot of great and free resources on a variety of different topics. The content is mostly a combination of other free content found elsewhere so the quality can vary.

[RefatoringUI Design Tips](https://twitter.com/i/events/994601867987619840)
These are from the designers/developer of TailWindCSS/TailwindUI and are tips for developers who build user interfaces.

[Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/)
Podcast on a huge variety of topics from Scott Tolinksi and Wes Bos.

[Get-Hot-Tips](https://wesbos.com/git-hot-tips/)
